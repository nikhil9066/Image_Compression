# Image Compression and Decompression

This Python script provides image compression and decompression using QR factorization and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It supports both QR and SVD methods for compression and decompression.

## Features

- Image compression and decompression using QR factorization and SVD.
- Visualization of cumulative energy graphs and singular values.
- Evaluation of accuracy through Mean Squared Error (MSE) and accuracy percentage.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib Pillow
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-compression.git
    cd image-compression
    ```

### Install Dependencies

2. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This will install NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pillow (PIL), which are necessary for the image compression and decompression script.

Now you're ready to use the image compression and decompression script.
